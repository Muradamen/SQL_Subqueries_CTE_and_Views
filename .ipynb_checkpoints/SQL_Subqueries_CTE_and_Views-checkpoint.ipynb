    "- **Subqueries** are great for simple, inline filtering or aggregation, but they can become difficult to manage when **nested deeply**.  \n",
    "  They're evaluated **for each row** when used in the `WHERE` or `SELECT` clause.\n",

    "- **CTEs** are best for improving **readability** and **manageability** of complex queries.  \n",
